# What is this

This is a sample repository that decrypts an encrypted text. You can specify an encrypted text and the encryption key as the tool's arguments, then the tool will show a plain text. Originally I created the tool for an additional content of [my manga-site "RESIGN THREAT"](https://www.resign-threat.com/). For this reason, the repository is just a sample. But you may be able to get some knowledges about how to decrypt an encrypted text using Python.

# How to use

Simply run `python des-decrypt-sample.py [encrypted-text] [key]` then the decrypted text will be shown on stdout.
