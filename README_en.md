# What is this

This is a sample repository that decrypts an encrypted text. You can specify an encrypted text and the encryption key as the arguments, then this will try to descrypt the text and show a plain text. Originally I created the program for an additional content of [my manga-site "RESIGN THREAT"](https://www.resign-threat.com/). For this reason, the repository is just a sample. But you may be able to get some knowledges about how to decrypt an encrypted text using Python. Also I want you to visit [my manga site](https://www.resign-threat.com/) and try to decrypt the encrypted words using the program!

# How to use

Simply run `python des-decrypt-sample.py [encrypted-text] [key]` then the decrypted text will be shown on stdout.
